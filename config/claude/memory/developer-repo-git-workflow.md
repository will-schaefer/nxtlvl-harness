In the `~/Developer` workbench repo the user commits **directly to `main`** (single-author repo; `origin/main` tracked but pushed only when asked). Do **not** branch for routine commits here — that overrides the generic "branch off the default branch first" default.

**Why:** solo personal workbench; existing history (initial → intent → Phase-0 scaffold) is all linear on `main`, and the user expects a bare "commit" to land on `main`.

**How to apply:**
- Commit to `main`; don't branch unless asked; don't push unless asked.
- **Concurrent commits happen** — during a "commit" turn the user (or tooling) may commit in parallel, so the index/HEAD can shift under you mid-task. **Before `git commit --amend`, re-check `git log` / `git show HEAD`** to confirm HEAD is the commit you mean to reword. (2026-06-17: I amended a stray `.claude/settings.local.json` commit instead of the scaffold commit, then had to `git reset --soft <scaffold> && commit --amend` to repair it.)
- `.claude/settings.local.json` is tracked but accumulates session-generated permission grants; leave its working-tree changes **uncommitted** unless the user asks to include them. (An epitaxy WIP commit may sweep it in anyway — that's epitaxy's doing, not a rule change.)
- **EPITAXY automation (observed 2026-06-18, branch `nxtlvl-context-hooks-and-adr008`):** a background process commits in parallel AND switches branches (`main`↔feature, "epitaxy pre-switch" WIP commits). It can commit *your* working-tree changes under *its own* commit message before your `git commit` runs — yielding a confusing "nothing to commit." **Don't panic and don't redo work:** verify your changes landed by **content** (`git show HEAD:path`, `git diff --stat HEAD -- <paths>` → empty = clean), not by whether your own commit succeeded. **Never amend/rebase/force-push while epitaxy is active** — history is being rewritten under you; surgery risks real loss. The repo is no longer purely linear-on-main; check the current branch first.
