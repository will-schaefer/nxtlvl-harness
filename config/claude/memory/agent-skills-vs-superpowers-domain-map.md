Full comparative map at `docs/reference/agent-skills-vs-superpowers-domain-map.md` (written 2026-06-19 from a two-phase parallel-subagent scan of all 38 skills; agent-skills v1.0.0 / 24 skills, superpowers v6.0.3 / 14 skills).

Thesis: **agent-skills = horizontal SDLC library** (one broad skill per engineering discipline — API, security, perf, observability, frontend, CI/CD, docs, migration), **superpowers = vertical agent-orchestration spine** (subagent dispatch, worktrees, branch-finishing, plan execution, skill-authoring). ~9 workflows overlap; the rest is each plugin's unique territory, so they are **complementary, adopt-both**. Recurring quality pattern on overlaps: **agent-skills wins completeness/content depth; superpowers wins enforcement + battle-testing** → default merge is "agent-skills brain + superpowers enforcement spine." Doc has the 9 per-workflow verdicts + adopt/adapt/reject backlog + agent-skills' dangling-`references/` defects.

**Per-plugin depth (every skill profiled individually, written 2026-06-19 via a 3-scanner parallel fan-out):** `docs/reference/superpowers-distillation.md` (14 skills + the orchestration-spine interlock + ranked adopts — top: subagent-driven-development, writing-skills, systematic-debugging) and `docs/reference/agent-skills-distillation.md` (24 skills grouped by domain + house-style skeleton + defects — top adopts: security-and-hardening, source-driven-development, doubt-driven-development). **Corrected finding** now in all three docs: agent-skills' `references/*.md` links aren't missing — the files exist at the **plugin root** but the bare relative links resolve to a skill-relative path where they don't, so they break on resolution and orphan support content if a skill is lifted out.

One of the three reference harnesses to triangulate per [[triangulate-three-harnesses-build-decisions]]; companion to [[ecc-component-map]]. Extends [[nxtlvl-harness]].
