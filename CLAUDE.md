# CLAUDE.md — nxtlvl workbench

This repo builds **nxtlvl**, a personal Claude Code harness. Anchor:
[`docs/intent/personal-harness.md`](docs/intent/personal-harness.md). Decisions (ADRs):
[`docs/decisions/`](docs/decisions/).

## Build method — build from scratch against a production-quality standard
nxtlvl is built from scratch, guided by **`nxtlvl-wiki`** — a queryable corpus of reviewed
production harnesses that sets the reference bar without imposing anyone else's design
([ADR-002](docs/decisions/ADR-002-reference-corpus-nxtlvl-wiki.md),
[ADR-003](docs/decisions/ADR-003-build-from-scratch.md)). Harnesses in `reference/` are
study material; each review produces an ADR-recorded decision and a distillation under
[`docs/reference/`](docs/reference/). The main session orchestrates and delegates — **when
spawning a subagent during the build, pass this method along** so it knows we build against
the wiki's production standard, not from prior harness designs.

## Scaffolding new harness items — `sandbox/`
Build new skills/agents/commands in [`sandbox/`](sandbox/) — a staging tree **off the harness's
discovery path**, so work-in-progress isn't loaded, routed to, or warned about by the live plugin.
It mirrors the plugin's shape (`sandbox/{skills,agents,commands}/`); promote when ready with
`git mv sandbox/skills/<name> plugins/nxtlvl/skills/<name>` — the move *is* the activation. See
[`sandbox/README.md`](sandbox/README.md). For throwaway experiments use the gitignored
`*-workspace/` convention instead.

## ADR lifecycle
This repo follows the global decision rule's keep-never-delete lifecycle
(`~/.claude/rules/decisions.md` §3): a superseded ADR is **kept** as `status: Superseded` with a
`superseded-by:` pointer — never deleted — and its replacement may reference it. A project
override (e.g. delete-and-rewrite) remains available under §4 if a real need arises, but none is
in effect. The rest of the global ADR format applies — frontmatter, the
Context · Decision · Alternatives · Consequences body, the `docs/decisions/` location, and the
`README.md` index.

## nxtlvl-build conventions (project-specific, not global rules)
The global rules layer (`~/.claude/rules/` — decisions, context assembly, hook safety, git
workflow, visual design docs) carries only cross-project conventions. These are nxtlvl-build-specific and live here
(design: [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-30-nxtlvl-rules-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-30-nxtlvl-rules-design.md)):

- **Skill/agent authoring:** run the nxtlvl **brainstorming** skill before code, then the
  **show-me** spec → plan format, then review before merge. (ADR-012/ADR-013 are
  `Draft`/`Pending` — this is current provisional practice, not a recorded decision.)
- **Promotion/audit gate:** promotion into the live plugin is gated by `nxtlvl:audit` — **not
  yet built** (ADR-014 is `Draft`/`Pending`); rollback convention is a git tag per promotion.
  Aspirational until the gate ships.
- **Coverage check:** periodically compare the harness against the `nxtlvl-wiki` production bar
  ([ADR-002](docs/decisions/ADR-002-reference-corpus-nxtlvl-wiki.md)) — only meaningful while
  working on nxtlvl itself.
