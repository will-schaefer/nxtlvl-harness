description: Vendor an agent harness and analyze it via parallel read-only fan-out, in one of three modes — (A) a neutral deep-dive quality + architecture report (its domains, skills, agents, commands, hooks, tools, strategy, and workflow, scored against a rubric), or (B) an adopt/adapt/reject ledger that judges what a target harness should borrow from it, or (C) a deep single-component specialist audit of one subsystem — its hooks, agents, skills, commands, tools, or rules — scored against a domain-expert rubric. USE THIS whenever an agent harness, Claude Code plugin, .claude/-style repo, subagent collection, or agent framework comes up to be understood, evaluated, or mined — phrases like "review this harness", "analyze how <repo> works", "how good is this agent setup", "deep dive into <plugin>", "what should we adopt from <repo>", "vendor and distill X", "should we copy how they do Y", "review the hooks of <repo>", "how good is X's hook system", "audit the <component> of <harness>". This analyzes someone else's harness — NOT a code review of your own diff (use a code-review skill for that), and NOT building a harness.

# Harness Review — vendor → fan-out → (general review | adopt/adapt/reject | domain review)

A repeatable method for analyzing an **agent harness**: vendor the repo as a disposable working
copy, fan out parallel read-only analysis over its independent subsystems, and synthesize one
tracked, citable artifact. The analysis is durable; the clone is throwaway.

The skill runs in **three modes** — pick one in Phase 0. They share the expensive front half (vendor →
map → fan-out) and the tail (reader-test → land), and diverge only in what the fan-out produces, how
you synthesize, and what you write:

- **Mode A — General Review** *(neutral)*: a deep-dive **quality + architecture report**. Dissects
  the harness's components (skills, agents, commands, hooks, tools, rules/docs) and its strategy and
  workflow, and **scores** each against a shared rubric — judged on the harness's own terms.
  Answers *"how is this built, and how good is it?"* → detail in
  [`references/general-review.md`](references/general-review.md).
- **Mode B — Adopt / Adapt / Reject Ledger** *(decision-oriented)*: maps findings against a
  **target** harness you build or maintain and renders a borrow verdict per finding. Answers *"what
  should `<target>` adopt, adapt, or reject from this?"* → detail in
  [`references/adopt-adapt-reject.md`](references/adopt-adapt-reject.md).
- **Mode C — Domain Review** *(neutral, single-component)*: a deep specialist audit of **one
  component type** (its hooks, *or* agents, *or* skills, *or* commands, *or* tools, *or* rules),
  scored against a **domain-expert rubric** tuned to that component's real failure modes — the depth
  Mode A's whole-harness pass can't reach. Answers *"how good is this harness's `<component>`
  specifically?"* → framework in [`references/domain-review.md`](references/domain-review.md), rubrics
  in [`references/domains/`](references/domains/).

Read the relevant reference before your first run in a mode, or when a phase below needs more than
its summary. This body is the shared executable spine; the references are the per-mode rationale.

## Picking the mode (Phase 0)

Choose from the user's intent:

- *"How does X work / how good is it / analyze its architecture / deep dive on X"* → **Mode A**.
- *"What should `<target>` borrow from X / should we copy how they do Y / adopt-adapt-reject X / vendor and distill X for `<target>`"* → **Mode B**.
- *"Review the hooks of X / how good is X's agents / audit the `<component>` of X / deep-dive just the `<component>`"* → **Mode C** (the ask names one component type to go deep on).

Disambiguate by what the ask is *about*: one **component type** to audit in depth → **Mode C**; a
**target harness to improve** by borrowing → **Mode B**; the **whole reviewed harness** on its own
terms → **Mode A**. (Mode A's `FOCUS` can still narrow attention to a component, but it keeps the
generic rubric; reach for **Mode C** when you want the domain-expert rubric and a focused audit.)
When it's genuinely ambiguous, ask — don't guess.

## What this analyzes (and what it doesn't)

An **agent harness** means any system that shapes how an agent works: a Claude Code plugin, a
`.claude/`-style repo, a subagent collection, a skills/prompt library, or an agent framework.

**Good targets** (full pipeline): multi-component harnesses and substantial subagent/skill
collections. **Poor targets** (skim or skip): "awesome" meta-lists and single-file gists — they
yield a short note, not a report. When in doubt, start; a thin harness produces a thin result.

This is **not** a code review of your own working diff (use a code-review skill for that), and it
does not modify the harness — it reads and judges it. If the user means "review my code," route
there instead.

## The contract

**Shared input**
- **`REPO`** (required) — the GitHub URL or `owner/name` of the harness. (A local path works too;
  skip the clone in Phase 1.)

**Mode A also takes**
- **`FOCUS`** (optional) — a narrowing of attention when the user only cares about part of the
  harness (e.g. "just the hooks"). A lens for attention, not a comparison; the report judges the
  harness on its own terms. Absent a focus, analyze the whole harness.

**Mode B also takes**
- **`TARGET`** (required) — the harness you're deciding *for* (the one you build/maintain).
- **`LENS`** (required) — the specific `TARGET` surfaces this repo most plausibly informs. *This is
  the most important Mode-B parameter*: it's what turns a code-read into an adopt/adapt/reject
  judgment. State it before any work and **ask if it's unclear** — don't guess a lens.

**Mode C also takes**
- **`DOMAIN`** (required) — the component type to audit: one of `hooks`, `agents`, `skills`,
  `commands`, `tools`, `rules` (the registry in
  [`references/domain-review.md`](references/domain-review.md) §2). It selects the specialist rubric
  and tells the run where to look.
- **`FOCUS`** (optional) — a narrowing *within* the domain (e.g. "just the `PreToolUse` hooks"). Mode
  C is neutral — there is **no `TARGET`/`LENS`**; it judges the domain on the harness's own terms
  (borrow judgments are Mode B's job).

**Output:** a tracked artifact (default `docs/reference/<repo>-analysis.md` for Mode A,
`docs/reference/<repo>-distillation.md` for Mode B, `docs/reference/<repo>-<domain>-review.md` for
Mode C) plus the gitignored working clone, and a one-line index/memory pointer so it's findable later.

## The pipeline

Work the phases in order. Phases 0–2 and 6–7 are shared; Phases 3–5 fork by mode.

**Phase 0 — Frame & select.** State `REPO`, pick the **mode** (above), and state the mode's extra
inputs (`FOCUS`; or `TARGET` + `LENS`; or `DOMAIN` + optional `FOCUS`). Apply the good/poor-target
test and decide go/skip.

**Phase 1 — Vendor.** Clone shallow into a gitignored scratch location and measure:
```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git reference/<repo>-main
rm -rf reference/<repo>-main/.git        # flat, disposable working copy
du -sh reference/<repo>-main             # capture size
```
The clone needs network egress, so **run it with the sandbox disabled** — a permission action; if
you can't toggle it yourself, ask the user. The `rm -rf` only ever deletes the *fresh clone's own*
`.git`, so it is safe. Clones land under a gitignored path (`reference/` is local-only by
convention) — they are disposable; the analysis is the durable artifact, so don't track the clone.

**Phase 2 — Structural map & partition.** `find reference/<repo>-main -maxdepth 3` + read the README
intro. Inventory the components, then **partition the harness into independently analyzable domains**
(no shared state) so they can run in parallel. A `.claude/`-style harness partitions naturally into
roughly: (1) hooks/automation, (2) agents/orchestration, (3) skills/commands/rules + docs/periphery.
Adjust to the repo's real shape; 2–4 domains is typical. This partition is the key design choice of
the run, and it is the same for Modes A and B. **Mode C forks here:** instead of partitioning the
whole harness, it partitions *within* the chosen `DOMAIN` — one agent per artifact (hook script,
agent, …) when there are many, or a single deep agent when there are few (see
[`references/domain-review.md`](references/domain-review.md) §1).

**Phase 3 — Parallel fan-out analysis.** Dispatch one `general-purpose` agent per domain, **all in
one message** (compose `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents`). Every agent prompt — in any of the three
modes — MUST carry these shared elements:
1. **Read-only mandate** — "modify nothing; your output is a digest the main session synthesizes."
2. **Scoped target** — the exact files/dirs this agent owns + the absolute repo path.
3. **Claims-vs-wiring discipline** — separate what the docs *claim* from what the code *ships*; trust
   the wiring, cite every claim to `file:line`.

Then add the **mode-specific payload** — what the agent must produce:
- **Mode A:** analyze the domain *on its own terms* and **score it on the shared rubric** (cohesion,
  composition, robustness, discoverability, clarity, effectiveness; 1–5 each — see
  [`references/general-review.md`](references/general-review.md) §1). Output: what's there, how it
  works, strengths, weaknesses/risks, rubric scores with one-line justifications.
- **Mode B:** map findings against the **`LENS`** (the `TARGET` surfaces) and **end in an explicit
  Adopt / Adapt / Reject list** — see [`references/adopt-adapt-reject.md`](references/adopt-adapt-reject.md) §1.
- **Mode C:** load the **specialist rubric** for the `DOMAIN`
  ([`references/domains/`](references/domains/)`<domain>.md` §2) and **score each domain-specific
  dimension 1–5 with `file:line` justification**, judged on general best practice (nxtlvl's lessons
  are rationale, not the bar — see [`references/domain-review.md`](references/domain-review.md) §1).
  Output: what's there, how it works, strengths, weaknesses/risks, specialist scores.

Agents return *conclusions, not file dumps* — that preserves the main thread's context for synthesis.

**Phase 4 — Synthesize.** Read the digests and find the spine, then **separate signal from demo**
(teaching/demo repos ship deliberate filler — toy apps, demo domains — that must not be mistaken for
craft). The spine differs by mode:
- **Mode A:** the **central design strategy** that explains how the harness coheres (its
  orchestration model, how a task flows through it, what it optimizes for); roll the per-domain
  rubric scores into an **overall quality assessment**.
- **Mode B:** the **cross-cutting borrow finding** — frequently *not* a feature to copy but a
  contrast that confirms or challenges a decision `TARGET` already made.
- **Mode C:** the **headline judgment about the subsystem** — is it sound, what defines its quality,
  what caps it; roll the per-artifact specialist scores into an overall assessment, letting a fatal
  flaw in the domain's dominant dimension cap the overall rather than averaging it away.

**Phase 5 — Write the artifact.** Scaffold all headers first, then fill and review each section,
leading with the Phase-4 spine.
- **Mode A** → the deep-dive **report** ([`references/general-review.md`](references/general-review.md) §2): dated header · overview/thesis · architecture map · per-component deep-dive (each present
  component type) · strategy & workflow · scored quality assessment + verdict.
- **Mode B** → the **distillation** ([`references/adopt-adapt-reject.md`](references/adopt-adapt-reject.md) §2): dated header · numbered sections with `file:line` quotes · a consolidated **Adopt /
  Adapt / Reject ledger** mapped to `TARGET` surfaces · an "applying to `<target>`" close.
- **Mode C** → the focused **domain review** ([`references/domain-review.md`](references/domain-review.md) §3): dated header · spine (headline judgment) · what's there & how it works · a **specialist
  scorecard** (the domain's dimensions × 1–5) with strengths, weaknesses/risks, and a headline verdict.

**Phase 6 — Reader-test.** Dispatch a fresh-context agent to read the finished artifact cold: does it
stand alone, are the calls (scores / adopt-adapt-reject) justified by cited evidence, any unsupported
claim or missing citation? Fix what it surfaces.

**Phase 7 — Land it.** Add a one-line index/memory pointer so the artifact is findable later. Keep the
working clone gitignored or delete it — the analysis is the durable artifact. (Mode B: if a borrow
finding is architectural and expensive to reverse, raise it as a decision to record via whatever
decision-recording process `TARGET` uses; curate hard — most findings are notes, not decisions.)

## Knobs (what varies per run)

`REPO` is required; mode picks the rest (`FOCUS`; or `TARGET` + `LENS`; or `DOMAIN` + optional
`FOCUS`). Per-run knobs: domain partition (2–4, or within-domain for Mode C), fan-out agent count,
signal-vs-demo filter, and artifact depth. Full knobs tables live in each mode's reference (Mode C: §4).

## Gotchas worth knowing before you start

The phases carry the recurring traps (the spine and signal-vs-demo split are Phase 4; claims-vs-wiring
is Phase 3). Two that live outside the flow, in all modes:

- **Cross-check stale reference material** against current upstream docs before trusting it — a
  reviewed repo's own tables can be incomplete or out of date.
- **Judge the wiring, not the README.** A confident philosophy doc is not evidence of a robust hook;
  let the shipped code drive the score/verdict, and note any gap between claimed and actual as a finding.

## Composes (don't reconstruct)

- Phase 3 & 6 → `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents` (independent-domain fan-out; fresh-context
  reader for the cold read).
