Ingest the GitHub repo: $ARGUMENTS

The **orient → verify → cite** firewall is mandatory: a DeepWiki summary must never become
an uncited "fact." Refuse if the repo is off-scope (non-agent-harness).

1. **Orient (DeepWiki).** Query DeepWiki for the repo's structure and ask targeted questions
   to locate the interesting harness mechanics. Treat everything DeepWiki returns as
   **leads, not citations.**

2. **Verify (real source).** Resolve the repo's current commit **SHA**. Fetch the actual
   files DeepWiki pointed at, **at that pinned SHA**, and read them. Only what you read here
   may be cited.

3. **Capture.** Write an immutable `raw/<cluster>/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<repo>-reading.md`: URL,
   pinned SHA, the list of files actually read, and the distilled findings. **No vendored code** — describe and cite, do not paste source files.

4. **Compile.** First decide *what pages* the repo yields, then cite them.

   **Decompose into the entity + the patterns it demonstrates.** Identify the concepts and
   entities the repo touches, the way `/ingest` does for an article — don't collapse a repo into
   one monolithic page. A harness repo almost always yields a **`type: entity` page for the repo
   itself** *plus* a **`type: concept` page for each genuinely reusable pattern it demonstrates**
   (e.g. `mini-swe-agent` → a `stateless-subprocess-action-execution` concept), cross-linked so
   the pages form a connected cluster. The concept layer is where the wiki compounds: a pattern
   page is reachable from every repo that shares it, so pulling it out of the repo page is what
   makes the knowledge reusable beyond this one codebase. Calibrate to what's actually there — a
   genuinely single-purpose repo with no transferable pattern can stay one entity page; decompose
   by the ideas the source really contains, never manufacture filler concepts to hit a count.

   Cite across **two citation lanes** that the reconciliation rule ties together:
   - **Code claims → SHA-pinned permalinks** `owner/repo@<SHA>/path#Lx-Ly`, in footnotes
     **only** — they have no `raw/` node, so they never appear in `sources:`.
   - **Orientation/synthesis claims → the reading note.** A repo page's framing, distilled
     takeaways, and inventory facts come from the step-3 reading note, not from any single
     line of code, so they carry a `[^n]` citing `[[raw/<cluster>/<…>-reading]]`. That note
     is the page's `sources:` entry — and since `sources:` must equal the union of
     raw-targeting footnotes, **every page that lists the reading note in `sources:` must
     cite it at least once.** A page whose every claim is a permalink and that never cites its
     reading note fails the citation-reconciliation gate: give its orientation claim the
     `[^n]` it's owed (don't drop the reading note from `sources:` — the page genuinely
     derives from it).

   Append a `log.md` entry.

5. **Lint + commit (always, in this order).**
   - **Lint gate (mandatory).** Run `python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lint.py" --changed HEAD` — it
     deterministically checks the pages this ingest touched (wikilink resolution, orphans,
     citation reconciliation both directions, frontmatter floor) and exits non-zero on a HARD
     break. **Fix any HARD failure before committing** — for repo pages the usual culprit is a
     reading note in `sources:` that no footnote cites (see step 4). Unresolved research-lead
     links and orphans are WARN, not failures.
   - **Commit (always).** Once lint is clean, stage the ingest's files and commit directly to
     the working branch (the repo convention is one commit per ingest). Use a Conventional
     Commit (`feat: ingest <repo> …`) summarizing pages touched and any flagged caveats. Do
     **not** ask first — invoking `/ingest-repo` is the authorization.
