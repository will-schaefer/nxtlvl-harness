# Agent-Harness Atomic Taxonomy — the periodic table of harness engineering

> **Drafted 2026-06-22.** A complete, design-space-first decomposition of agent-harness
> engineering into its **atoms** — the smallest independently-specifiable units a harness is
> built, configured, or composed from — with a column mapping each atom to **nxtlvl's** reality.
>
> **Two jobs:**
> 1. **Foundational reference** — the harness-agnostic map of *what there is to build out of*,
>    independent of what nxtlvl chooses to build. Where the
>    [domain map](nxtlvl-domain-map.md) scopes *down* (most cells deliberately empty), this maps
>    the space *up* (exhaustive by construction).
> 2. **Backlog feeder** — every atom carries an nxtlvl status; atoms marked **◻ OPEN** are
>    uncovered design-space the harness has taken no position on, and are surfaced in
>    [§17](#17-open-atoms--intake-gate-candidates) as candidates for the reactive intake gate
>    ([ADR-015](../decisions/ADR-015-scope-determination-and-extension-gate.md)). **OPEN ≠ TODO** — most
>    stay OPEN until a real task earns them; the value is in *naming* them so the choice is
>    deliberate, not accidental.
>
> **Relation to the existing maps.** This is an **orthogonal axis** to
> [`nxtlvl-domain-map.md`](nxtlvl-domain-map.md). That map answers *"which subjects/workflows/
> subsystems does nxtlvl organize around?"* (its 3 layers). This one answers *"what primitive
> elements does any harness decompose into?"* — and the two compose: see
> [§16](#16-how-this-reconciles-with-the-three-layer-domain-map). For the concrete on-disk
> inventory, the authority remains [`nxtlvl-domain-catalog.md`](nxtlvl-domain-catalog.md); for
> the per-component-type review lens, the `harness-review` skill's
> [`references/domains/`](../../plugins/nxtlvl/skills/harness-review/references/domains/). **When
> any of those disagree with this doc, the filesystem wins** — regenerate the status column from
> `plugins/nxtlvl/` + `config/claude/`.

## What counts as an atom

An **atom** is a unit that satisfies all three tests:

1. **Independently specifiable** — you can describe, build, configure, or reject it on its own.
2. **Irreducible *for harness purposes*** — splitting it further drops below the harness layer
   into platform internals (token sampling, file I/O) that no harness re-implements.
3. **Compositional** — it combines with other atoms to form the components, subsystems, and
   workflows of the [three-layer map](nxtlvl-domain-map.md), but is not itself one of those.

Atoms group into **families** (the "groups" of the periodic table) by the engineering concern
they serve. Families A–N below are exhaustive over the concerns; atoms within them are
exhaustive over the *current understanding* of the design space and grow as harness review
([CLAUDE.md build method](../../CLAUDE.md)) surfaces more.

---

## The coverage column — status legend

Each atom's nxtlvl status, per the build philosophy in
[`personal-harness.md`](../intent/personal-harness.md):

| Mark | Status | Meaning |
|:--:|---|---|
| ⬛ | **NATIVE** | Provided by the Claude Code platform; **never reconstructed** — the floor under everything ([ADR-003](../decisions/ADR-003-compose-not-reconstruct.md)). nxtlvl *uses* it, doesn't own it. |
| ✅ | **BUILT** | Ships today in `plugins/nxtlvl/` (plugin layer) and/or `config/claude/` (global layer). |
| 🟡 | **PLANNED** | Committed via ADR / spec / plan / backlog; not yet on disk. |
| ⛔ | **REJECTED** | Deliberately not built — a recorded *no* (ADR or intent). |
| ⚪ | **OOS** | Out-of-scope: nxtlvl takes no position and builds nothing here; the runtime backstop is **native Claude Code** (ecc is ingested reference-corpus only — via nxtlvl-wiki — not an installed fallback; recurring gaps go to nxtlvl-labs incubation, [ADR-002](../decisions/ADR-002-reference-corpus-nxtlvl-wiki.md)). |
| ◻ | **OPEN** | A real design-space atom nxtlvl has taken **no position on**. Feeds the intake gate (§17). |

> **Layer note.** "BUILT" spans two config layers — the **plugin** (`plugins/nxtlvl/`, the
> versioned/promoted artifact) and the **global** (`config/claude/`, the linked `~/.claude`
> surface: `settings.json`, `memory/`, `rules/`, `output-styles/`, `statusline-command.sh`).
> The `(g)` tag in the Pointer column marks atoms that live in the global layer rather than the
> plugin.

## A · Orchestration primitives — the native floor

*The dispatcher, the loop, the window. nxtlvl's first principle is that these stay native: a
hand-built version is structurally a slower, capped shim around the real one
([`personal-harness.md`](../intent/personal-harness.md):57–61).*

| ID | Atom | One-line | nxtlvl | Pointer / note |
|--|--|--|:--:|--|
| A1 | Skill routing | Description-triggered selection of which skill loads for a prompt | ⬛ | The router *biases* (D8); dispatch is native |
| A2 | Agent dispatch | Spawning an isolated subagent (`Task`/`Agent` tool) | ⬛ | nxtlvl owns *which* agents + *when*, not the mechanism |
| A3 | Deterministic multi-agent control | DAG-style fixed multi-agent execution (`Workflow` tool) | ⬛ | Intent: "deterministic control uses native `Workflow`" |
| A4 | Tool-use loop | The reason→call-tool→observe→repeat cycle | ⬛ | — |
| A5 | Context-window assembly | Platform-side packing of the prompt window | ⬛ | nxtlvl shapes *inputs* (family D), not the packer |
| A6 | Model inference / sampling | Token generation itself | ⬛ | — |
| A7 | Subagent context isolation | Each agent's own fresh window | ⬛ | The substrate delegation rides on (G) |
| A8 | Permission enforcement engine | The allow/deny/ask decision machinery | ⬛ | nxtlvl writes the *rules* (B5); platform enforces |

---

## B · Packaging & configuration

*How the harness is declared, layered, installed, versioned, and permissioned.*

| ID | Atom | One-line | nxtlvl | Pointer / note |
|--|--|--|:--:|--|
| B1 | Plugin manifest | The `plugin.json` that declares the plugin | ✅ | `plugins/nxtlvl/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` ([ADR-001](../decisions/ADR-001-plugin-local-marketplace-packaging.md)) |

| B5 | Permissions (allow/deny/ask) | The permission ruleset the engine (A8) enforces | ✅ | `settings.json` (g) |
| B6 | Permission modes | Default / accept-edits / plan / bypass posture | ⬛ | Platform feature; nxtlvl sets defaults |
| B7 | MCP server config | Declaring MCP servers the harness exposes | ✅ | `plugins/nxtlvl/.mcp.json` (context7, deepwiki) |
| B8 | Namespace | The `nxtlvl:` prefix isolating the surface | ✅ | [`personal-harness.md`](../intent/personal-harness.md):13 |
| B9 | Versioning / promotion tag | git-tag-per-promotion = rollback unit | 🟡 | [ADR-001](../decisions/ADR-001-plugin-local-marketplace-packaging.md); install script exists, tag ritual pending |
| B10 | Dev/prod separation | Workbench repo vs. installed daily driver | ✅ | This repo = workbench ([`personal-harness.md`](../intent/personal-harness.md):134–142) |
| B11 | Output style | Persona/format shaping of responses | ✅ | `config/claude/output-styles/co-builder.md` (g) |
| B12 | Keybindings | Terminal shortcut customization | ⚪ | Native config; not nxtlvl-managed |
| B13 | Statusline | Live session readout line | ✅ | `config/claude/statusline-command.sh` (g) |

---

## C · Components — the authored surface

*The five-plus component types every harness assembles from. The decisive tells live in
[`ecc-agent-vs-skill-scoping.md`](ecc-agent-vs-skill-scoping.md) and
[ADR-012](../decisions/ADR-012-agent-design-contract.md).*

| C11 | Bundled script | Executable shipped inside a component | ✅ | `skills/crop/scripts/`, `lib/*.js` |
| C12 | Shared library | Cross-component helper code | ✅ | `plugins/nxtlvl/lib/` (atomic, paths, scrub, recall…) |
| C13 | Sub-agent of an agent | An agent that itself spawns agents | ⬛ | Mechanism native; composition is G |

---

## D · Context assembly & injection

*The harness's defining daily job: what earns a slot in the model's attention. The learning
artifact is the **policy**, not the plumbing ([ADR-008](../decisions/ADR-008-context-assembly.md)).*

| ID | Atom | One-line | nxtlvl | Pointer / note |
|--|--|--|:--:|--|
| D1 | Global memory file | Durable cross-project conventions | ✅ | `config/claude/CLAUDE.md` (g) |

| D5 | Context budget / token accounting | Every injected block justifies its tokens | ✅ | [ADR-008](../decisions/ADR-008-context-assembly.md); enforced as policy |
| D6 | Pointers-over-content | Inject a pointer ("read docs/…"), not the payload | ✅ | [ADR-008](../decisions/ADR-008-context-assembly.md) hard rule |
| D7 | Compaction steering | Steer the summary so the task thread survives `/compact` | ✅ | `hooks/precompact.js` |
| D8 | Per-prompt relevance routing | The router skill biasing skill selection | ✅ | `skills/nxtlvl-router/` |
| D9 | Imported / `@`-referenced files | CLAUDE.md transclusion of other files | ⬛ | Native CLAUDE.md feature; available, used sparingly |
| D10 | Context-pressure awareness | Alert as the live window fills | ✅ | `hooks/context-alert.js` (two-stage) |
| D11 | Session bookmark recall | Surface the newest "left-off" bookmark at start | ✅ | `lib/bookmarks.js` + `briefing.js` |
| D12 | Retriever / RAG over a corpus | Embed-and-fetch external knowledge into context | ⛔ | Hand-built retriever = the orchestration anti-goal ([`personal-harness.md`](../intent/personal-harness.md):182) |

---

## E · Memory & learning

*Extend native file-memory; **never** a fourth store
([ADR-007](../decisions/ADR-007-memory-architecture.md)). The instinct lifecycle is nxtlvl's
own learning loop.*

| ID | Atom | One-line | nxtlvl | Pointer / note |
|--|--|--|:--:|--|
| E1 | Native file memory | `MEMORY.md` + `memory/*.md` durable store | ✅ | `config/claude/memory/` (g) |

| E8 | Write discipline / honesty | No "degraded mode that lies" (the ruflo anti-pattern) | ✅ | [`ruflo-distillation.md`](ruflo-distillation.md) learn-against |
| E9 | Concurrency guard | Single-flight so parallel sessions don't corrupt memory | ✅ | [ADR-007](../decisions/ADR-007-memory-architecture.md); `observe.js` guard |
| E10 | Role/agent-scoped memory | Per-role evolving memory (hive pattern) | ⚪ | Architectural contrast only ([`hive-analysis.md`](hive-analysis.md)) |
| E11 | Cross-session episodic store | Long-term assistant-style memory | ⛔ | "A fourth memory system" — explicitly out ([`personal-harness.md`](../intent/personal-harness.md):235) |

---

## F · Lifecycle hooks (the event surface)

*Lean, flat (one per event+matcher lane), fail-open on error
([ADR-010](../decisions/ADR-010-hook-layer-contract.md)). The event column is the
**full native surface**; nxtlvl occupies a subset.*

| F8 | SubagentStop | Fire when a subagent finishes | ◻ | Uncovered |
| F9 | Notification | Fire on a notification event | ◻ | Uncovered |
| F10 | Exit-code contract | 0 = pass/warn (stderr = nudge), 2 = block | ✅ | [ADR-010](../decisions/ADR-010-hook-layer-contract.md) |

| F14 | Flat registration / dispatcher | One hook per lane until a lane earns a multiplexer | ✅ | [ADR-015 hook corollary](../decisions/ADR-015-scope-determination-and-extension-gate.md) |
| F15 | Detached background spawn | A hook launching non-blocking async work | ✅ | `observe.js` spawns detached observer |

## G · Composition & orchestration (the authored layer above native)

*Native gives dispatch (A); nxtlvl owns the **composition** — who delegates to whom, when, and
how outputs merge ([ADR-016](../decisions/ADR-016-orchestration-model.md)).*

| ID | Atom | One-line | nxtlvl | Pointer / note |
|--|--|--|:--:|--|

## H · Tooling & external capability

*The action surface — built-ins, MCP, and how tools are scoped per executor.*

| ID | Atom | One-line | nxtlvl | Pointer / note |
|--|--|--|:--:|--|
| H1 | Built-in tools | Read/Edit/Write/Bash/Glob/Grep/etc. | ⬛ | Platform |
| H2 | Per-agent tool scoping | Restricting an agent's tool set | ✅ | e.g. read-only reviewers ([ADR-012](../decisions/ADR-012-agent-design-contract.md)) |

## J · Observability & metrics

*You cannot improve a harness you cannot measure — but the north-star metric is **open**. The
prior fallback-rate model is superseded ([ADR-002](../decisions/ADR-002-reference-corpus-nxtlvl-wiki.md)
rejects an automated coverage metric; coverage is now assessed **deliberately** against
nxtlvl-wiki), and the replacement metric is re-posed as an open question
([ADR-011](../decisions/ADR-011-observability-and-metrics.md), Draft).*

| ID | Atom | One-line | nxtlvl | Pointer / note |
|--|--|--|:--:|--|
| J1 | Fallback log | Hook-written record of every `ecc:` reach | ✅ | `hooks/fallback-log.sh`; code exists but model superseded per [ADR-002](../decisions/ADR-002-reference-corpus-nxtlvl-wiki.md); observability pending [ADR-011](../decisions/ADR-011-observability-and-metrics.md) |
| J2 | North-star metric | Was "fallback-rate by session"; that model is superseded — the north-star is now **open** | ✅ | `lib/metrics.js`; code exists but model superseded per [ADR-002](../decisions/ADR-002-reference-corpus-nxtlvl-wiki.md); observability pending [ADR-011](../decisions/ADR-011-observability-and-metrics.md) |

## L · Capability / subject-matter domains (the L1 axis)

*The subject buckets components file under — enumerated here only at the **family** grain;
the full taxonomy + scoping is [`nxtlvl-domain-map.md`](nxtlvl-domain-map.md) §2.*

## M · Safety, isolation & recovery

*Restraint by construction — the harness can block, but stays "a book on the shelf, not a
coworker" by enabling few gates.*

| ID | Atom | One-line | nxtlvl | Pointer / note |
|--|--|--|:--:|--|
| M1 | Execution sandbox | OS-level command sandboxing | ⬛ | Platform sandbox; nxtlvl works within it |
| M2 | Isolation boundary | Subagent / read-only boundaries | ✅ | H2/H3 |
| M3 | Permission prompts | Ask-before-acting friction | ⬛ | Platform; nxtlvl tunes via B5 |
| M4 | Rollback | git-tag + reinstall = sub-minute recovery | 🟡 | [`personal-harness.md`](../intent/personal-harness.md):141; rides B9 |
| M5 | Fail-open philosophy | Errors never halt; blocks are clean decisions only | ✅ | [ADR-010](../decisions/ADR-010-hook-layer-contract.md) |

## N · Model & inference layer

*The knobs on the engine the harness sits on. Mostly native; the harness *chooses*, it doesn't
build.*

| ID | Atom | One-line | nxtlvl | Pointer / note |
|--|--|--|:--:|--|
| N1 | Model selection | Which model per agent/task | ✅ | e.g. observer pinned to `claude-sonnet-4-6` (`observe.js`) |
| N2 | Reasoning / thinking budget | Extended-thinking depth | ⬛ | Platform knob |
| N3 | Prompt caching | Reuse of cached context across calls | ⬛ | Platform |
| N4 | Token / context-window budget | The window size being managed | ⬛ | Managed via family D |
| N5 | Fast mode | Faster Opus output toggle | ⬛ | Platform (`/fast`) |
| N6 | Per-task model routing policy | A rule choosing cheap vs. capable models | ◻ | Ad-hoc today; no codified policy |

## 16. How this reconciles with the three-layer domain map

The two maps are **orthogonal** and multiply rather than overlap:

```
                 ATOMIC TAXONOMY (this doc)  →  the building blocks (families A–N)
                                ×
THREE-LAYER MAP (nxtlvl-domain-map)  →  how nxtlvl scopes & arranges them
   L1 capability · L2 workflow · L3 architectural · NATIVE floor
```

- The domain map's **NATIVE floor** = family **A** (every atom marked ⬛) plus the ⬛ atoms in
  H/M/N. Same boundary, named at the atom grain.
- The domain map's **L3 architectural subsystems** are each *composed of* atoms here: *Context
  assembly* = family **D**; *Memory* = **E**; *Hooks* = **F**; *Composition* = **G**;
  *Audit* = **I3–I7**; *Fallback-log+metric* = **J**; *Config/packaging* = **B**.
- The domain map's **L2 workflows** (review/dev/research) are **G10/G11** here — assemblies of
  capability atoms over the subsystem atoms.
- The domain map's **L1 capability domains** are family **L** at family-grain (the domain map
  holds the full taxonomy).

So: **a subsystem (L3) is a named cluster of atoms; a workflow (L2) is a path through atoms; a
capability (L1) is a filing bucket over them.** This doc enumerates the parts; the domain map
arranges them.

## 17. OPEN atoms → intake-gate candidates

The backlog-feeder payload. These are atoms with **no current nxtlvl position** (◻ OPEN) — real
design-space that exists but the harness hasn't engaged. **Listing is not committing**: each
enters only via the written intake gate ([ADR-015](../decisions/ADR-015-scope-determination-and-extension-gate.md)),
when a real task names it and an existing thing fails. Surfaced here so the *non*-decision is
visible.

| Atom | Why it's open | Cheapest first move if a task earns it |
|--|--|--|
| **F7 · Stop hook** | No turn-end hook; the stop-slop gate ([ADR-024](../decisions/ADR-024-prose-quality-stop-slop.md)) is the obvious tenant | Wire `Stop` to the stop-slop check once I8 ships |
| **F8 · SubagentStop hook** | No subagent-completion hook; could compose G5 output-merging | Defer until a delegation pattern needs post-processing |
| **F9 · Notification hook** | Unused native event | Defer; no driving task |
| **C6 · Custom (non-MCP) tool** | All external capability is MCP today (H4); no bespoke tool | Only if a need resists both built-ins and MCP |
| **J7 · Telemetry export** | Metrics are local JSONL; no external sink | Defer until cross-machine metric aggregation is real |
| **N6 · Per-task model-routing policy** | Model choice is ad-hoc (N1 is per-component) | Codify a cheap-vs-capable rule once cost/latency bites |

> **Confirmed *no*s are not OPEN.** D12 (RAG retriever), E11 (4th memory), G9 (self-evolving
> topology), J8 (audit-delta), K14 (optimizer loop) are ⛔ **REJECTED** — recorded decisions, not
> gaps. Reopening one is itself an ADR.

## Maintenance

- **Regenerate the status column** from `plugins/nxtlvl/{commands,agents,skills,hooks,lib}` +
  `config/claude/` whenever the surface changes; the filesystem and the
  [catalog](nxtlvl-domain-catalog.md) win over this doc on any disagreement.
- **Families A–N are stable**; atoms grow as harness review surfaces more of the design space.
  A new atom is a one-row add with a status; a status flip (◻→✅, or ⛔ reopened) should cite the
  ADR/commit that moved it.
- **This doc maps the space; what grows into it is decided deliberately** — coverage assessed
  against nxtlvl-wiki ([ADR-002](../decisions/ADR-002-reference-corpus-nxtlvl-wiki.md)), with the
  observability metric re-posed as open ([ADR-011](../decisions/ADR-011-observability-and-metrics.md), Draft) —
  the same through-line as the domain map.
